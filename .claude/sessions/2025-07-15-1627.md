# Development Session - 2025-07-15 16:27

## Session Overview
**Start Time:** 2025-07-15 16:27  
**Project:** Voice Command Results TTS Enhancement  
**Current Status:** Implementing core text processing functionality

## Goals
- Complete Task 2: Implement Core Text Processing Module
- Build foundational text extraction and word counting for TTS system

### Update - 2025-07-16 10:28

**Summary**: Fixed hook spawn error and implemented debugging for local TTS notifications

**Git Changes**:
- Renamed/Modified: .claude/hooks/stop.py (re-enabled with debug logging)
- Modified: .claude/settings.json (added Stop and SubagentStop hooks)
- Modified: .claude/hooks/subagent_stop.py, .claude/hooks/utils/tts/tool_filters.py
- Current branch: create-tool-specific-content-filters (commit: bfb997a)

**Todo Progress**: 7 completed, 0 in progress, 0 pending
- ✓ Completed: Re-enable hooks one at a time to identify the issue
- ✓ Completed: Test stop.py execution manually first
- ✓ Completed: Check file permissions on stop.py.disabled
- ✓ Completed: Verify uv environment is working
- ✓ Completed: Add stop hook back to local settings.json
- ✓ Completed: Investigate global vs local hook conflict
- ✓ Completed: Debug why local hook isn't firing

**Issues Encountered**:
- Local Stop hook was firing but with `stop_hook_active: false`, preventing TTS playback
- TTS failures were happening silently due to `capture_output=True` and broad exception handling

**Solutions Implemented**:
1. **Root Cause Fixed**: Restored global ~/.claude/settings.json from backup - the missing global settings was causing hook system failures
2. **Local Hook Enhancement**: Added SubagentStop hook to catch subagent events alongside existing Stop hook
3. **Debug Mode**: Modified local stop.py to show TTS output and log debug info to logs/tts_debug.log
4. **Testing Ready**: Both global and local hooks now configured and ready for dual-voice testing

**Code Changes Made**:
- stop.py: Removed `capture_output=True` and added debug logging for TTS troubleshooting
- settings.json: Added both Stop and SubagentStop hook configurations

**Next Action**: Session restart needed to test dual-voice notifications (global + local) with debug logging active.
- Prepare for integration with PostToolUse hook
- Maintain simple architecture approach
